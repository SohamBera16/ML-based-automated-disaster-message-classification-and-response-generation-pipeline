# ML based automated disaster message classification and response generation pipeline

## Project Overview:
In this project, a machine learning pipeline has been developed to categorize a data set containing real messages that were sent during disaster events so that the messages can be automatically sent to an appropriate disaster relief agency. This project also includes a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app also displays visualizations of the data. 

## Steps to execute the codes:

 Clone the repository using the following command -
     git clone https://github.com/SohamBera16/ML-based-automated-disaster-message-classification-and-response-generation-pipeline.git
     
 First, install the necessary packages which are the necessary dependencies for the codes to run using the command -
 
     $ pip install -r requirements.txt
