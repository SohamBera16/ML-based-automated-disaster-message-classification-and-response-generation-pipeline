# ML based automated disaster message classification and response generation pipeline

## Project Overview:
In this project, a machine learning pipeline has been developed to categorize a data set containing real messages that were sent during disaster events so that the messages can be automatically sent to an appropriate disaster relief agency. This project also includes a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app also displays visualizations of the data.
